Advent of Code solutions

:warning: Warning  
These are not super optimized or even the best solutions for each problem.  
They are simply the solution I arrived when I solved each problem.  

Days 3, 4, 5 don't have the complete solution since I ended up solving the rest of the problem in a `pry` console.  
Day 6 and forward should have the full solution for each part
